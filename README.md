# Google-Earth-Engine-MAD
The script of Google Earth Engine for Change Detection Analysis

This is the sript for Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) for Google Earth Engine. The MAD can be used for many purpose of change analysis which transforms the data to correlation space. With this method, the change detection and pseudo-invariant features for multitemporal images can be extracted.


## Quick Start Guide
You just determine the input image and the area based on the coordinate subset area. In the map, the layer can be set to changed and unchanged pixels / area.
